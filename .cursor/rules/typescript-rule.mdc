# TypeScript Usage Rules

## General Rule

Always use TypeScript (.ts/.tsx) files instead of JavaScript (.js/.jsx) files for all application code.

## Exceptions

- The Node.js `zip.js` library file can be used in its JavaScript form.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. When writing new code, always create .ts or .tsx files.
2. When referencing or importing modules, prefer TypeScript versions.
3. When suggesting modifications to existing code, convert JavaScript to TypeScript where possible.
4. Ensure proper type definitions are included for all code.
5. For any JavaScript code that must be used (like the zip.js exception), consider using declaration files (.d.ts) to provide type information.

## Rationale

TypeScript provides stronger type safety, better IDE support, and helps catch errors at compile time rather than runtime, leading to more robust applications.

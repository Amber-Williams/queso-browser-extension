  Queso is a browser extension that serves as an advanced bookmark manager for your reading and research workflow. It allows you to bookmark articles, save quotes, and add notes to your bookmarks. All data is sent only to the user's configured server of choice, and never shared with third parties.

  FEATURES:
  • Bookmark articles and blog posts to your reading list with one click
  • Save quotes from any webpage directly to your bookmarks using the context menu
  • Organize content with custom tags for easy retrieval
  • Track your reading progress with read/unread status
  • Add personal notes and annotations to your saved bookmarks
  • Estimate reading time for better time management
  • Access your bookmark collection from the convenient side panel or popup

  Queso transforms traditional bookmarking by helping you build an intelligent bookmark library that captures not just links, but the valuable content and insights you discover while browsing. Perfect for researchers, students, writers, and anyone who wants to organize their online discoveries beyond simple link saving.

  To get started, add your API configuration in the settings page, then start saving content from anywhere on the web.

single-purpose-description: |
  Queso has a single purpose: to serve as an intelligent bookmark manager that helps users save and organize web content for later reading and research purposes.

permissions:
  activeTab: |
    The activeTab permission is required to access information about the current webpage that the user is viewing. This is essential for Queso's core functionality of capturing content from the active tab, including the page title, URL, article text body (for read time estimation), and add a highlighted text to their notes. Without this permission, Queso would not be able to append essential web page metadata from the current webpage.

  storage: |
    The storage permission is essential for Queso to save and retrieve user bookmarks, saved quotes, notes, and user preferences. This permission enables the extension to securely persist bookmark data locally for the user, and store settings needed to sync their bookmarks to their own server. Without storage permission, Queso would not be able to maintain the user's bookmark collection across browsing sessions, remember their API configuration, or fulfill its core purpose of organizing bookmarked content for later access.

  sidePanel: |
    The sidePanel permission is used to provide users with a convenient interface to access their saved content without leaving the current webpage. This enhances the user experience by allowing them to add notes, and organize content in a side panel while browsing. The side panel is a key component of Queso's content organization functionality, making multi-page content possible as users conduct web research across multiple pages or sites pertaining to a single topic.

  contextMenus: |
    The contextMenus permission enables Queso to add bookmark options to the browser's right-click context menu, allowing users to quickly bookmark selected text as quotes or highlight text as notes. This permission provides a streamlined bookmarking workflow, making it easier for users to save information they find valuable while browsing. This quick-save functionality is central to Queso's purpose of helping users efficiently bookmark web content.

host_permissions:
  'https://*/*': |
    Queso requires access to all HTTPS websites because its primary purpose is to allow users to bookmark content from any secure website they visit. Most modern websites use HTTPS, and users expect to be able to bookmark articles, save quotes, and add notes from these sites. This permission enables Queso to inject the necessary content scripts to extract page information and process bookmarking requests when a user chooses to save content, regardless of which secure website they are visiting.

    Queso does not store any site information. It was built with a settings page so the user can point all reading data to be uploaded on their own server.
